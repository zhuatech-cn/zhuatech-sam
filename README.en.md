# ZhuaTech Software Asset Management

> A source-available enterprise project by [ZhuaTech](https://www.zhuatech.cn/) for enterprise business operations and digital management.

ZhuaTech Software Asset Management provides a practical, self-hosted foundation for enterprise business operations and digital management. It is designed for business users, process owners, approvers, and system administrators, with clear business records, controlled workflows, operational visibility, and auditable actions.

This repository is intended for learning, technical evaluation, and non-commercial collaboration. The included implementation, tests, database resources, and container configuration provide a reproducible starting point for further enterprise adaptation.

**Search topics:** enterprise software asset management, self-hosted software asset management, Java Spring Boot enterprise software, digital transformation.

## Solution Overview

- **Primary users:** Business users, process owners, approvers, and system administrators.
- **Deployment model:** Self-hosted, with container-based local deployment where supported.
- **Governance baseline:** Role-aware operations, validation, approval boundaries, exception handling, and auditability.
- **Production boundary:** Review security, identity, backup, observability, capacity, and compliance controls before production use.

## Business Coverage

- **Business master data** — Manage business master data with ownership, validation, and explicit lifecycle states.
- **Lifecycle workflow and approvals** — Coordinate lifecycle workflow and approvals through controlled workflows and approval gates.
- **User and administration workspaces** — Track user and administration workspaces metrics, exceptions, deadlines, and follow-up actions.
- **Exception and risk controls** — Preserve exception and risk controls evidence in searchable, traceable operational history.
- **Operational dashboards** — Expose operational dashboards in role-aware user and administration workspaces.
- **Traceable audit history** — Connect traceable audit history to external systems through configurable integration boundaries.

## Implementation Stack

**Technology stack:** Java 21 · Spring Boot · Vue 3 · Vite · MySQL 8 · Docker Compose
